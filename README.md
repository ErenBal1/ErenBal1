### Welcome to My Profile ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,

Hello! I'm Eren, an enthusiastic student studying Computer Engineering (English) at Istanbul University of Health and Technology. My passion for the world of mobile application development has led me to work on the Flutter framework and to continuously improve myself in this field. Although I do not have professional work experience yet, I am gaining practical experience in mobile application development through my personal projects and academic studies. Since my introduction to Flutter, I have been impressed by the possibilities offered by this powerful cross-platform framework. By learning the Dart programming language and using various technologies, I have gained skills in designing user-friendly interfaces and developing functional applications. I am also developing myself in topics such as state management, API integration and basic database operations. Currently, I am looking for a job opportunity to consolidate my theoretical knowledge with practical experience and learn best practices in the industry. I aim to increase my knowledge and skills by working with experienced professionals working in the field of mobile application development, while contributing to creative and innovative projects. I believe that I will be a valuable employee in the field of mobile application development with my openness to learning, problem solving ability and teamwork. I like to follow the rapid changes in technology and constantly update myself.
