### Welcome to My Profile ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,

Hello! I'm Eren, an enthusiastic Computer Engineering (English) student at Istanbul Health and Technology University. My passion for mobile app development has led me to focus on the Flutter framework and continuously improve my skills in this field. Although I don't have professional work experience yet, I'm gaining practical experience in mobile app development through personal projects and academic studies.
Since discovering Flutter, I've been impressed by the possibilities this powerful cross-platform framework offers. By learning the Dart programming language and using various technologies, I've acquired skills in designing user-friendly interfaces and developing functional applications. Additionally, I'm improving my knowledge in areas such as state management, API integration, and basic database operations.
Currently, I'm seeking a job opportunity to reinforce my theoretical knowledge with practical experience and learn industry best practices. I aim to increase my knowledge and skills by working alongside experienced professionals in mobile app development while contributing to creative and innovative projects.
With my openness to learning, problem-solving ability, and aptitude for teamwork, I believe I will be a valuable employee in the mobile app development field. I enjoy keeping up with rapid changes in technology and constantly updating myself.
